# Introduction to Django

Welcome to my **Introduction to Django** project!  
I created this project to get hands-on experience with Django — one of the most popular and powerful web frameworks for building modern, scalable web applications with Python.

## 🎯 Objectives

This project is organized around three main goals:

### 1. Set Up the Django Development Environment
- Install Django using `pip`.
- Create a brand new Django project.
- Explore the default project structure.
- Run the development server and ensure everything is working.

### 2. Implement and Interact with Django Models
- Create a Django app within the project.
- Define models using Django’s ORM, including all necessary fields.
- Use the Django shell to:
  - Perform **Create**, **Read**, **Update**, and **Delete (CRUD)** operations.
  - Query and update data directly from the shell.

### 3. Work with the Django Admin Interface
- Register my models with the Django admin site.
- Customize how the models appear in the admin.
- Use the admin interface to manage and view data easily.

## 🛠️ What I’m Learning
- How Django projects and apps are structured
- How to build and manage data models using Django’s ORM
- How to use the Django admin for data management
- Best practices for getting started with Django development

## 🚀 Outcome
By the end of this project, I’ll have a solid foundation in Django and be more confident building and managing web applications using this framework.

## 📚 Prerequisites
Before starting, I made sure I had:
- Basic Python knowledge
- Python and pip installed on my system
